# MultiFilterSynth
A software synth developed in C# and WPF! Still in progress. Eight oscillators passed thru several bandpass filters. Download, build it and start the wpf project and try to create some simple sounds. Push buttons to patch oscillators to the filter bank. A sequencer is running in the background. Still, much, much work to do. All synth code is in the SynthCore project. To be continued...
